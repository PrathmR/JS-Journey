# 🎲 Pig Game

A fun, interactive two-player dice game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points!

## 🕹️ How to Play

- Two players take turns rolling a die.
- Each roll adds to the player’s **current score**.
- If a player rolls a **1**, their turn ends and their **current score resets to 0**.
- A player can **"Hold"** to add their current score to their **total score** and end their turn.
- The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game!
